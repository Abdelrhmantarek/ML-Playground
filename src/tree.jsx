			expl2: ["Basically flowcharts. You begin at the root node. Based on the value of one feature (or sometimes more), we go to the left or right child of the tree. Et cetera, until we arrive at a leaf node, and then we make a prediction based on that leaf.",
				"It's easy to follow a tree once you've constructed one - it's a very simple chain of 'yes/no's and true/falses. The interesting part is obviously making the tree.",
				"There are various algorithms for making trees out there, but in general all work towards minimizing entropy. Not the physical kind, but the Informational kind. In the context of a decision tree and nodes, entropy is high when points arriving at a node vary a lot in terms of their labels. If we have a tree that buckets equal numbers of orange and purple points together, this tree has high entropy and is bad. Vice versa - if we end up bucketing orange points together, and purple points separately, then there is low entropy, and this is a good tree.",
				"Another key component is the backpropogation algorithm. Because of the network's straightforward structure, we can mathematically find a way to optimize our network. We calculate a 'gradient', which involves calculating derivatives for each individual neuron, and then adjusting all the weights accordingly. We adjust the weights by going back from the last layer to the first - hence 'back propogation' of weight updates.",
				"A lot of cooler applications of Neural Networks revolve around using more complex forms than a simple Dense network (as presented here).",
				"Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are experts at image processing, as they 'Convolve' across the whole image, ie. scan the image with a smaller moving window.",
